# Somenage

An interactive design system for telling stories.

## Features

1. Renders Semantic HTML5 code validated by W3C.
2. Aligns elements to the typographic grid.

## Built on

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), for static rendering.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), for interactivity.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), for scalable code.
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), for style objects and functions.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/), for testing theme, hooks and components.
- [JsDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) with [BetterDocs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs), to generate API documentation.

This stack is the result of endless trials and errors.

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), Javascript with [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html), [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/), [Material UI](https://styled-components.com/) were the contenders. They've all got dismissed after proving incompetent for this particular project.
