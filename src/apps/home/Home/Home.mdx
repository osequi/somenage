[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), Javascript with [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html), [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/), [Material UI](https://styled-components.com/) were tried and dismissed after proving incompetent for this particular project.

## Packaging

Currently there is no packaging.

[Bit](https://bit.dev/), [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) were tried and dismissed due to very low developer experience inflated with extended developing time.
