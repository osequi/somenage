# Somenage

An interactive design system and tools for creating visually compelling stories.

## Features

- Color scheme designer.
- Elements aligned to a typographic grid.
- Semantic HTML5 code outlined by W3C.

## Built on

- [Next.js](https://nextjsd.org), for static rendering.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), for interactivity.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), for scalable code.
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), for style objects and functions.
- [MDX](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx), for content experience.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/), for testing theme, hooks and components.
- [JsDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) with [BetterDocs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs), to generate API documentation.

This current stack is the result of trials and errors.

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), Javascript with [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html), [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/), [Material UI](https://styled-components.com/)&mdash;all tested&mdash;are not suitable now for this particular project.

## Structure

- `theme` - Type declarations and settings.
- `hooks` - Business logic to connect the theme with components.
- `components` - Visual building blocks of the design system.
- `apps` - Apps and tools built on the design system.

Every layer separates concerns.

- `theme` is standalone, contains settings and no business logic.
- `hooks` builds on theme, contains logic, no settings.
- `components` build on hooks. When reusable business logic surfaces it goes refactored into hooks.
- `apps` build on components.

## Packaging

Publishing to packages is not implemented yet.

[Bit](https://bit.dev/), [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)&mdash;all tested&mdash;offer, for now, low developer experience inflated with extended developing time.

As an aid, Next's [absolute imports and module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) makes easy to link the project parts together.

Importing with path aliases like `"@components/typography";` is possible anywhere in the project no matter the project structure.
